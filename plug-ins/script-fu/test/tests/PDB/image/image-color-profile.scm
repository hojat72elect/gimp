; Test color profile conversion operations on image

; color profiles are in files
; ~/.local/share/icc on Ubuntu for local displays i.e. monitors
; Are they communicated from the monitors themselves when monitor sensed at startup?

; These tests are not now testing the algorithms themselves,
; only the crude algebra of calls to the API.
; That is, we don't render the image and have a human look at the results.
; Also, there is no API for programmatically finding what rendered colors are out of gamut.
; Also, there is no API for programmatically rendering under the simulation profile.
; i.e. like the user would do under View>Color Management>SoftProof.
