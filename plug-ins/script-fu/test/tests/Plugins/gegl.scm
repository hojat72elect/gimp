; Test GEGL plugins

; This can also be stress test for GIMP itself: opens hundreds of images

; WORK IN PROGRESS
; This is brute force, it doesn't test effects, mainly tests for crashes.
; The API is very new and subject to change.

; HISTORY
; For plugin authors porting older plugins.
;
; In GIMP 2 (say about 2.8) many filters were moved to GEGL
; and in GIMP, wrapper plugins were defined in the PDB.
; The wrappers were defined in /pdb/groups/plug_in_compat.pdb
; A wrapper procedure was named like plug-in-antialias,
; where "anti-alias" is a name of a wrapped filter in GEGL
; Not all GEGL filters were wrapped.
;
; Some GEGL filters appear in the GUI (apart from Gegl Ops menu.)
; via app/actions/filters-actions.c and image-menu.ui (xml)
;
; Since GIMP 3, new procedures were added to the PDB for a plugin
; to "use" a GEGL filter.
; Filters are "added" to a layer.  They are initially NDE (non-destructive)
; After adding a filter, they can be "merged" meaning convert to destructive
; (the effect becomes more permanent, the parameters of the filter
; can no longer be tweaked, i.e. the filter is no longer parameterized.)
;
; The new API in the PDB is:
; gimp-drawable-filter-new etc.
; ScriptFu also has new functions (not in the PDB):
; gimp-drawable-filter-configure, gimp-drawable-filter-set-aux-input,
; gimp-drawable-merge-filter, gimp-drawable-append-filter, etc.
;
; The wrappers also declared ranges for formal args, matching GEGL declared ranges.
; Since wrappers no longer exist, GEGL declared ranges are the only ones effective.
;
; The new API lets an author call ANY Gegl plugin.
; Formerly, some Gegl filters had no wrapper, so you could not call them.


; ABOUT THE TESTS
;
; Each test is a simple call.
; No test for effectiveness, only that a call succeeds.

; Some tests omit args: ScriptFu calls anyway,
; and some machinery (where?) substitutes a default value for actual arg.
; Note some arguments (e.g. drawables) are not defaultable.

; This tests that the formal args declared for the PDB wrapper
; are at least as restrictive in range as declared by GEGL.
; Otherwise, throws CRITICAL: ...out of range...

; When defaulting args, you can't see in the displayed image that tests are effective:
; default args may produce all black, or all transparent, etc.
; IOW, the defaults are not always sane.

; FIXME: color args should default also?
; Possibly a flaw in GeglParamColor.

; If you add tests for effectiveness, leave the defaulted tests.
; Since they have a testing purpose: test PDB declared defaults.

; Most are fundamental filters, and unlikely to change,
; unlike some of the other filters not migrated to GEGL.
